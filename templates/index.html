For example, when it comes to audio-visual content, it is important to have legally available services that are high in demand and that people want to consume.

This proposed amendment (which has not yet been incorporated into the Directive) provides that using content already made available online for purposes such as criticism, review, illustration, caricature, or parody is lawful provided the source is accurately identified and the use is consistent with fair practice.

The value gap is the disparity between the large revenues of large online platforms such as Google and Facebook, and the low revenues of press publishers. It was intended as a way of redistributing Google’s revenues to small publishers. The reality is far less straightforward: the resulting proposal will not only fail to redistribute Google’s revenues to those who need it, but it will also hamper our ability as online users to engage with one another on the internet.' %}</p>

				<ul>
					<li>{% trans 'In Spain where a snippet levy is in place, Google has not paid a share of their advertisement-based revenues to news publishers.

The problem is that some of the content uploaded on the Internet infringes the copyright of other content creators.

				<p>{% trans 'If you have ever uploaded content to social media, or watched a creative video someone else uploaded, this proposed reform could affect you.
